      As application workloads share cluster resources, it is important to specify resources
      requested and consumed by each Pod. Requiring resource requests per Pod is recommended,
      especially for memory and CPU. If a Namespace level request is specified, defaults will
      automatically be applied to each Pod based on the LimitRange configuration. This policy
      validates that all containers have something specified for memory and CPU requests.
