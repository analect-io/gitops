## Argo Workflows

### What is Argo Workflows?
Argo Workflows is an open source container-native workflow engine for orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes. Argo Workflows is implemented as a Kubernetes CRD.

Define workflows where each step in the workflow is a container.
Model multi-step workflows as a sequence of tasks or capture the dependencies between tasks using a graph (DAG).
Easily run compute intensive jobs for machine learning or data processing in a fraction of the time using Argo Workflows on Kubernetes.
Run CI/CD pipelines natively on Kubernetes without configuring complex software development products.

### Why Argo Workflows?
Designed from the ground up for containers without the overhead and limitations of legacy VM and server-based environments.
Cloud agnostic and can run on any Kubernetes cluster.
Easily orchestrate highly parallel jobs on Kubernetes.
Argo Workflows puts a cloud-scale supercomputer at your fingertips!
